Selection Sort Algorithm(a short brief on selection sort)

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

The subarray which already sorted. 
The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. 



Easy steps to solve the problem

- Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0.
- Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array.
- While traversing if any element smaller than min_idx is found then swap both the values.
- Then, increment min_idx to point to the next element.
- Repeat until the array is sorted.
